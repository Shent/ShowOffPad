= ShowOffPad =

iPad app to present ShowOff presentations from.  It will allow you to 
sync a ShowOff presentation that is online to your iPad, then let you
serve the presentation off the iPad itself.  It supports the external
monitor dongle, so you can plug a projector into the iPad directly.

You can swipe or tap the image to advance the slides and it also has 
a drawing mode so you can draw directly onto the presenter display,
Madden style. Boom!
