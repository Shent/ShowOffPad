ShowOffPad
==========

iPad app to present ShowOff presentations from.  It will allow you to 
sync a ShowOff presentation that is online to your iPad, then let you
serve the presentation off the iPad itself.  It supports the external
monitor dongle, so you can plug a projector into the iPad directly.

You can swipe or tap the image to advance the slides, it shows how far
through the slides you are, how much time has elapsed and notes for each
slide. It also has a drawing mode so you can draw directly onto the 
presenter display, Madden style. Boom!
